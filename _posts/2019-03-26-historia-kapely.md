- **Performance** - Static files can be served fast There is no server-side processing and no database to connect to, meaning that there is nothing to slow down getting a static page from the server to your end user. This also means that there are no bottlenecks that might cause slow requests when you encounter a significant traffic surge. Additionally, web servers will automatically set caching headers (such as Last-Modified) for static files, which reduce bandwidth usage.
- **Security**: Static websites are immune to the most common attacks, as they do not contain dynamic content. There is no server-side language issues to exploit and no database to hack. Basically, as long as the files on your host are secure, your static site is secure.
- **Content versioning**, since your entire site, from configuration to content, is filebased, it is very easy to keep all aspects of it within a version control system like Git.
- **Simplicity** - Building and maintaining websites is incredibly simple.
- Use markdown Previewable: Because static sites are developed locally, you can play around with the site to your heart’s content without affecting the live site.
- **Hosting**: Since no server-side language is required, hosting requires no complicated setup or maintenance, making it cheap and easy. In fact, there are even free options, like GitHub pages.

Despite these benefits, static sites, even with the help of a static site generator, are not the solution for every type of site.
